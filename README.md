# DeepLearning

This repo contains real world projects solved using Neural networks with Pytorch and other frameworks.This assumes that you already have familiarity with
NN architectures such as CNN,RNN ,GAN etc.,

# How to use them

- Each project will have a directory named after the objective it is going to achieve. 

_Example_: **DeployNN** specifically covers deployment of NN models in cloud hosted environments such as AWS

- Please create an AWS account for example and verify your service quotas for sagemaker notebook,training,transformation and deployment jobs/
